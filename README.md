# Introduction to time series
## A brief and practical guide

In this repo you will find material regarding the initial steps in time series modeling. 
In the notebook `timeseries.ipynb`, a theoretical definition of time series, descriptors such as the **mean** and the **autocovariance function**(ACF), and the **autocorrelation function **(ACF) are presented. Additionally, the concept of **stationarity** is studied. We also explore **Trend Techniques** ranging from **moving average** to **autoregressive models**.

All this material is a practical code guide using historical copper price data in Chile. We employed `statsmodels`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` for demonstrating the introduced concepts.
